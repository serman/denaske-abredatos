Copy Service Connect into your modules directory (i.e. sites/all/modules).
Before installing Service Connect, you need to download the OAuth library.

You can do this with the following commands (from the module directory):

  wget http://oauth.googlecode.com/svn/code/php/OAuth.php
  mv OAuth.php oauth.lib.php

Or with curl:

  curl -O http://oauth.googlecode.com/svn/code/php/OAuth.php
  mv OAuth.php oauth.lib.php

Alternatively, you may download this file by hand from:

  http://oauth.googlecode.com/svn/code/php/

Only download OAuth.php and rename it to oauth.lib.php, so that you have:

  sites/all/modules/serviceconnect/oauth.lib.php

The module directory may be different.

Enable Service Connect on admin/build/modules or use "drush en serviceconnect".
